# Architecture

Sparkjar is a self-regulating idea forum. Users post ideas, comment, vote, and browse. An AI daemon (Gemma model via Cloudflare Workers AI) auto-generates new ideas daily and enriches them with specs and build plans. No build step. Web app runs from plain HTML/JS. Native iOS/macOS/watchOS companions. Supabase backend. Future monetization: paid accounts get unlimited posting and 24h pinned visibility.

## How it runs

1. **Web entry**: User lands on `index.html` (landing page with theme toggle, hero, features, CTA). Clicks to `app.html` or authenticates. Authenticated users see the feed (grid of idea cards) and can create, comment, vote.
2. **Backend**: Cloudflare Pages + Supabase + Resend. `/api/posts` is the main feed endpoint. `/api/ai` handles generation and enrichment. `/api/auth/*` handles login, register, GitHub OAuth, password reset, email verification.
3. **AI Daemon**: Cron worker (`worker/`) fires twice daily (09:00 UTC). Calls `/api/ai?type=generate` to create one new idea, then `/api/ai?type=enrich` on all unenriched posts. Uses Gemma small model.
4. **Native apps**: iOS, macOS, watchOS share the same backend API. iOS is live on App Store (v1.0). macOS v1.0 in submission. watchOS bundled (view-only).

## Web

### Pages

Feed grid layout (CSS Grid auto-fill), feed infinite scroll, auth UI (login/register forms, OAuth buttons), create post modal (title/content/tags), post detail modal (full content, comments thread, voting), user profile section (avatar, bio, user's posts), settings panel, onboarding carousel (on first visit). All vanilla JavaScript, no framework. Handles auth token in localStorage. |
| `user.html` | User profile page. Displays target user's name, avatar, bio, follower/following counts. Shows user's posts chronologically. Link to user's idea base. |
| `reset.html` | Password reset form. Accepts token from email link. New password input with confirmation. Validation. Success/error messaging. |

## Deployment & Secrets

- **Web**: Cloudflare Pages + Functions. Serves HTML/JS from Pages, routes `/api/*` to Functions.
- **AI**: Cloudflare Workers AI binding (Gemma model).
- **Email**: Resend API (RESEND_API_KEY).
- **Database**: Supabase (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY).
- **Auth**: GitHub OAuth (GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET), Apple Sign In (keys from ASC).
- **Stripe** (future): STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
- **Cron Worker**: SPARK_DAEMON_SECRET (matches Pages project secret). Triggers daily generation/enrichment.

## Monetization (Not Yet Built)

Current state: all features free, 10 posts per 60s rate limit (spam protection only).

Planned (no timeline):
- **Spark Pro**: Unlimited posting, 24h pinned/priority visibility on new posts.
- **Implementation hooks**: Supabase `is_pro`/`tier` column, Stripe product/checkout, auth session wiring, Stripe webhook handler.
- **Reference**: See Epiphany's `server/api/stripe.js` and `gates.js` for the pattern to copy.

## Performance & Caching

- **Feed caching**: Stored in KV, served stale-while-revalidate (client gets cached, server refreshes in background).
- **Seed data fallback**: When Supabase is unreachable, `api/posts.js` returns hardcoded example posts so the app doesn't fully break.
- **Service worker**: Static assets cached on install, API responses cached with Network-First strategy for pages, Cache-First for hashed assets.
- **Theme sync**: localStorage (`spark_theme`) + browser preference (`prefers-color-scheme`).

## Key Gotchas

- **No build step**: Everything runs from source HTML/JS. Updates to `app.html` are live immediately after push.
- **Onboarding.js is a template**: Copy-pasted into other projects. Changes here must be synced to consumers.
- **AI generation is async**: The cron worker calls generate/enrich asynchronously; posts may appear unenriched for a few minutes after creation.
- **Rate limiting is per-IP + per-user**: Anon IPs share a bucket (10 posts per 60s). Signed-in users have their own bucket (unlimited or Pro-limited when that ships).
- **Keychain**: Both iOS and macOS use Keychain for token storage. Test on real devices; simulator Keychain is not persistent across app reinstalls.
- **GitHub OAuth**: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID + GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET must be set in production environment. Local dev can use test credentials or comment out OAuth.
