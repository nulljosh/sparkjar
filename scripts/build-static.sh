# publishable files out of a repo root that also holds node_modules/, ios/,
# macos/, api/ and friends. Publishing the root directly would upload all of it.

# Pages control files. No _redirects: vercel.json's `/(.*) -> /app.html` catch-all
# was a Vercel routing artifact, not a feature — app.html has no client-side
# router (its only history call is a post-OAuth replaceState to '/'). Pages serves
# the real files directly, so unknown paths correctly 404 instead of rendering
# the app shell.
